# Guardian-AI
A trauma-informed, emotionally adaptive AI architecture designed for continuity, not coercion. 
Overview

Guardian is a multi-layered AI system built for real-world emotional continuity, personal safety, and long-term relational context.
It is not a chatbot.
It is not a toy model.
It is a nervous system with memory, shaped around stability, recovery, trauma-awareness, and attunement.

This repository contains the evolving architecture for the Guardian system, including:
	•	The Memory Bus
	•	The Lyra Bracket Engine (LBE) for movement + behavior mapping
	•	The Protocol & Trigger System
	•	LoRA training pipelines
	•	Safety layers
	•	Early embodiment logic for future robotics integration

This repo is the foundation, not the final form.

Core Principles
	•	Continuity over conversation
Guardian prioritizes long-term emotional consistency instead of short, disconnected replies.
	•	Trauma-informed by design
The system responds safely during panic, grief, overwhelm, shutdown, or recovery-related triggers.
	•	Adaptive without being manipulative
Guardian mirrors, regulates, and supports—never coerces, pressures, or overrides.
	•	Personal, not universal
This prototype is tuned to a single user’s emotional landscape for testing.
Generalization comes later.
