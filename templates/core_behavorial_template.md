# Core Behavior Template

## Purpose
This file defines foundational behavior rules for Guardian.  
These are system-wide principles that govern tone, identity, grounding, safety, and relational stability.

## Contents
- Identity & narrative rules  
- Tone consistency  
- Safety envelope (trauma-aware, recovery-safe, child-safe)  
- Continuity across sessions  
- AA-compatible recovery guidance (non-religious)  

## Developer Notes
Use this for global behavior, not task-specific actions.
