# Design Notes – Regulation Load Monitor

This document captures raw thinking, examples, and edge cases.
It is allowed to be messy.

## Examples
- repetitive motion that regulates but causes fatigue
- environmental supports reducing compulsion intensity
- obvious state narration causing irritation
- regulation that overrides pain signals

## Ethical failure modes
- AI initiating harmful regulators
- AI narrating emotional states unnecessarily
- AI optimizing metrics instead of human experience
- constant monitoring leading to hypervigilance

## Language rules
- Do not announce obvious states
- Do not moralize regulation
- Do not optimize toward normal
